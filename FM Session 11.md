## Weighted Avg Cost of Capital Framework
- 50% Cost of Debt + 50% Cost of Equity
- 50% are weights
- Debt  = Debt Markets
- Equity = Equity Markets

## Bond Market

	- Go to bond markets and raise bonds/debentures
	- Sources(Listed on Stock Market):
		- Banks(Syndicated Loans)
			- Not Traded in Mkt
		- Issue of NCB/D - Non Convertible Bonds/Debentures
			- Traded in Mkt
		- Similarities: Principal + Interest

				- Public Instruments
				- Specify Face Value
				- Coupon Rate
				- Tenure
				- Not applicable to Bank Loan
	- Treasury Bills can only be issued by the Gvt
- Raise Equity

## Example of Debt Mkt
- Comp decides to sell a new issue of 7 year 15 % bonds of Rs 100 each at par. If the bonds are redeemed at the cost of capital will be?

0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7
<br>
100	-15	-15	-15	-15	-15	-15	-115

- Face Value = 100
- Coupon Rate = 15%(Not Interest Rate)
- Tenure = 7 Years

- **Calculate Expected Rate of Return or IRR(Excel)**
- **Yield to Maturity(YTM) = 15%**

- Suppose Tax Rate = 35%
- Cost of Debt(kd) = 0.15\*(1-0.35) = 0.0975

- YTM = Cost of Debt = Return/Interest to the Investor

- Discount Bond
	- 2% Discount on Face Value
	<br>
	0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7
	<br>
	98(2% Discount on 100)	-15	-15	-15	-15	-15	-15	-115
	<br>
	__YTM = 15.49%__

- Premium Bond
	- 5% Premium on Redemption
	<br>
	0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7
	<br>
	100	-15	-15	-15	-15	-15	-15	-120(-5 More than -115)
	<br>
	__YTM = 15.45%__

- Par Bond
	- No Discount, No Premium
