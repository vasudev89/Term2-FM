## Weighted Avg Cost of Capital Framework
- 50% Cost of Debt + 50% Cost of Equity
- 50% are weights
- Debt  = Debt Markets
- Equity = Equity Markets

## Bond Market
- Raise Debt(Debt Instruments)
	- Go to bond markets and raise bonds/debentures
	- Sources(Listed on Stock Market):
		- Banks(Syndicated Loans)
			- Not Traded in Mkt
		- Issue of NCB/D - Non Convertible Bonds/Debentures
			- Traded in Mkt
		- Similarities: Principal + Interest
		- Dissimilarities:
			- NDB/D(*Bond Market*): 
				- Public Instruments
				- Specify Face Value
				- Coupon Rate
				- Tenure
				- Not applicable to Bank Loan
	- Treasury Bills can only be issued by the Gvt
- Raise Equity
	- Common
		- Face Value
		- Dividend Clause
		- Has no Specifics
	- Preferred(Similar to Bonds)
		- Face Value
		- Tenure
		- Dividends

## Example of Debt Mkt
- Comp decides to sell a new issue of 7 year 15 % bonds of Rs 100 each at par. If the bonds are redeemed at the cost of capital will be?

- Without Tax: 100	-15	-15	-15	-15	-15	-15	-115
	- YTM = 15%
- After Tax:   100	-9.75 -9.75 -9.75 -9.75 -9.75 -9.75 -109.75
	- YTM = 9.75%

- Face Value = 100
- Coupon Rate = 15%(Not Interest Rate)
- Tenure = 7 Years

- **Calculate Expected Rate of Return or IRR(Excel)**
- **Yield to Maturity(YTM) = 15%**

- Suppose Tax Rate = 35%
- Cost of Debt(kd) = 0.15\*(1-0.35) = 0.0975

- YTM = Cost of Debt = Return/Interest to the Investor

- Discount Bond
	- 2% Discount on Face Value
	<br>
	0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7
	<br>
	98(2% Discount on 100)	-15	-15	-15	-15	-15	-15	-115
	<br>
	__YTM = 15.49%__

- Premium Bond
	- 5% Premium on Redemption
	<br>
	0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7
	<br>
	100	-15	-15	-15	-15	-15	-15	-120(-5 More than -115)
	<br>
	__YTM = 15.45%__

- Par Bond
	- No Discount, No Premium

- Interest Always shields tax

## Example 2:
- Floatation Cost = pymt to investment banker
- 14% Coupon Rate
- Face Value = 15000000
- Tenure = 5 Years
- Last 3 years pay off 15000000 equally(-5000000 each year) 
- 5% redemption premium -> last 3 years
- 10% cost in floatation which is also tax reducible
- 15000 Received from Investors
- -1500 Paid to investment banker
- Actual Inflow from Bond Issue = 13500
- 14% Coupon Rate = 15000 * 14% = -2100
- Refer Excel Example for further details

## Interest Rates - M3 Money Supply
	- M1 is the money supply that encompasses physical currency and coin, demand deposits, traveler's checks, and other checkable deposits
	- M2 is a measure of the money supply that includes cash and checking deposits (M1) as well as near money
	- M3 is a measure of the money supply that includes M2, large time deposits, institutional money market funds, and short-term repurchase agreements
## Interest Rates - Positive Correlation with Inflation
## Gvt Spending goes up - Fiscal Deficit Rises
	- Gvt prints more money
	- M3 goes up if the country's notes are printed by Foreigners 
	- Pakistan printed fake Indian Notes to increase fiscal deficit
	- Lack of Sovereign Right: Right to control country's own currency
