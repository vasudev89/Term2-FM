## WACC - Weighted Average Cost of Capital
- Discount rate in the NPV Framework
- Proportion of Debt used in total Finance
- Cost of Debt + Prop of Equity * Cost of Equity
- Wd * Kd + We * Ke = WACC
- Kd
	- NCD/B
		- Bond Value
			- Find YTM = Kd
			- Kd = Rf(Risk Free Rate: Treasury Bill rate - Sovereignity of Currency, Fiscal Deficit) + Default Premium(Company Related -> Ratios)
		- Credit Rating
			- Example of Firms that give a rating: CRISIL, ICRA, Moody's etc
			- Mandatory for Public Issue Debt Instruments
			- AAA: is a very good and safe bond rating
			- AA: Very Strong likelihood that interest and principal will be repaid
			- A: Strong ability to repay but vulnerable to change with circumstances
			- BBB: Adequate ability to repay but more vulnerable in economic circumstances
			- Parameters for Rating:
				- Ratios
					- PBT Int Coverage
					- EBIDTA Int Coverage
					- Debt Ratio
						- Debt/Capital
							- Should be less than 1: Capital can be used to pay debt
	- Bank Loan
		- Internal Credit Rating
			- CIBIL
				- Internal Credit Rating Methods for Individuals
				- Credit Card usage history
				- Payment History(Key)
		- Ke = Expected value of return from Equity Investors = Rf + Equity Mkt Premium
			- Dividend Discount Model
			- Ke = Rf + Beta * (Rm-Rf) => CAPM
			- Beta = 
			- Rm = Equity Mkt Return
			- Efficient Mkt Portfolio
- Recovery = Principal Recovery
- Return = Interest Recovery
- In either NCB/D and Bank Loan: Int Coverage and Debt Ratio are analyzed
